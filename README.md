## Image Handling

Due to limitations in the official Are.na API (which doesn't support direct image uploads or posting), this extension uses a workaround via Cloudflare Workers and R2 storage. Images uploaded through this process are temporary, thanks to an object lifecycle policy on the R2 bucket that automatically deletes them after a set time.

1. A pre-signed upload URL is requested from the Cloudflare Worker.
2. The image is uploaded to the R2 bucket.
3. A pre-signed fetch URL is generated.
4. The URL is passed to Are.na's "post block" endpoint, allowing you to post the image.
